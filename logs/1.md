PostgreSQL client successfully installed on Ubuntu system. The installation included libpq5, postgresql-client-16, and the main postgresql-client package (version 16). System also detected a pending kernel upgrade from 6.11.0-26 to 6.11.0-29 and recommended a reboot, along with some deferred service restarts.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.

Initialized Node.js project "brain6" with Git repository setup. Created frontend and backend directories, then set up the backend with Express.js dependencies (express, cors, helmet, morgan) and nodemon for development. Successfully installed full PostgreSQL 16 server with contrib extensions - created new database cluster and enabled PostgreSQL service. System continues to show pending kernel upgrade recommendation.RetryJ

- Created database `brain6` with dedicated user `brain6_user` 
- PostgreSQL is running on **port 5433** (non-standard port)
- Modified `/etc/postgresql/16/main/pg_hba.conf` to use `md5` authentication instead of `peer` for local connections
- Successfully tested connection with password authentication
- Database connection requires port 5433 (not default 5432)
- Use credentials: user `brain6_user`, database `brain6`, localhost:5433
- Connection string format: `postgresql://brain6_user:password@localhost:5433/brain6`
- In Node.js apps, specify `port: 5433` in database configuration

Here's your updated development log:

**2025-08-04 [Current Time]**
- **Frontend Setup**: Initialized React application in `frontend` directory using `npx create-react-app . --template typescript` which automatically created package.json, installed all React dependencies, and set up complete TypeScript React project structure with src/, public/, and node_modules/ folders.

- **Environment Variable Configuration**: Implemented dotenv-based configuration management for both frontend and backend applications. Installed dotenv package in backend directory. Created .env files in both project roots to handle configurable ports and API endpoints.

- **Backend Environment Setup**: Created backend/.env file with PORT=3001 (adjusted for nginx reverse proxy configuration), database connection parameters (DB_HOST=localhost, DB_PORT=5433, DB_NAME=brain6, DB_USER=brain6_user), and NODE_ENV=development. Updated server.js to load environment variables using require('dotenv').config() and use process.env.PORT with fallback to 5000.

- **Frontend Environment Setup**: Created frontend/.env file with PORT=4201 (for nginx routing to dev.jimboslice.xyz) and REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api-dev.jimboslice.xyz (pointing to backend through nginx reverse proxy). Created src/config.js file for centralized API configuration management using REACT_APP_ prefixed environment variables.

- **Nginx Integration Planning**: Configured application to work with existing nginx reverse proxy setup where port 4201 routes to dev.jimboslice.xyz (frontend) and port 3001 routes to api-dev.jimboslice.xyz (backend API). This eliminates need for users to access applications via raw port numbers and provides clean, professional URLs.

- **Security Implementation**: Added .env files to .gitignore in both directories to prevent accidental commit of sensitive credentials. Created .env.example template files in both projects showing required environment variables without exposing actual values.

- **CORS Configuration Update**: Modified backend Express server to accept requests from both nginx domain (https://dev.jimboslice.xyz) and local development (http://localhost:4201) using cors middleware with origin array and credentials enabled.

- **Basic Server Structure**: Created server.js in backend with Express application setup, middleware stack (helmet for security, cors for cross-origin requests, morgan for logging, express.json for JSON parsing), and test endpoint at /api/test that returns JSON response with message, port, and timestamp.

- **Frontend Debugging Session**: Encountered white screen issue when accessing React application. Currently troubleshooting potential causes including JavaScript errors, port conflicts, incomplete create-react-app installation, environment variable syntax issues, or missing dependencies. Investigating browser console errors and terminal output to identify root cause.

White screen error fixed, looking at a template screen given in the App.tsx, am yet to really add anything to this file.
