Based on the provided context, your essay appears to focus on the role of soap in British society and empire during approximately 1780-1830, with several key themes:

1. Soap as a Tool of British Imperial Identity
- How soap helped create distinctions between "civilized" British and "uncivilized" colonial subjects
- Its role in colonial anxieties and how British people used it to cope with the "otherness" of colonies
- The unique Protestant/evangelical aspect that made cleanliness a moral issue in Britain

2. Soap's Domestic Role in Britain
- Class distinctions through cleanliness and smell
- Material and technological developments
- How it differed from other colonial commodities (tea, sugar, coffee) by being physically transformative

3. Political and Social Context
- Connection to the abolition movement and "civilizing mission"
- William Wilberforce's cleanliness campaigns
- How even progressive reformers used soap to assert British/Christian superiority

4. Unique Aspects of Soap as a Colonial Commodity
- Its inscription on the body itself rather than just being consumed
- Connection to miasma theory and ideas about biological superiority
- How it supposedly transformed users into "more civilized" people rather than just marking social status

The essay seems to argue that soap was uniquely powerful as a colonial commodity because it was seen as physically and morally transformative, not just a marker of social status like other colonial goods.
