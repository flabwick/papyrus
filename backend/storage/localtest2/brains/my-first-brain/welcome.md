# Welcome to Brain6!

This is your first brain - a knowledge base where you can store and organize your thoughts, notes, and files.

## Getting Started:
1. Create cards to store your knowledge
2. Link cards together using [[card-title]] syntax
3. Organize cards into streams for different topics
4. Upload files and they'll automatically become cards

## Features:
- **File Storage**: Upload any file type and it becomes searchable
- **Card Linking**: Connect related ideas with [[links]]

- **Search**: Find anything across all your cards
- **CLI Access**: Manage your brain from the command line

Happy knowledge building! ðŸ§
